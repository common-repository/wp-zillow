WordPress Zillow Demographic Charts Plugin was developed to provide a website owners with an easy way to add dynamic demographic details to real estate realted posts and pages.

== Description ==
`EASY TEMPLATE CUSTOMIZATION FOR BETTER DISPLAY OF CHARTS NOW ADDED THIS RELEASE`
The UltimateIDX Presents, WP Zillow API for WordPress Real Estate Blogging at its best. Developed originally for our client use only, we have released this tool as a contribution to the WordPress community in support of the Worlds best Real Estate website platform, WordPress. This plugin provides blog website owners with a truly easy to manage easy to integrate charting solution for Zillow Demographics that can be put into your blogs posts and pages.

Tested with version 2.8.4 and WordPress MU, the plugin can support hundreds of chart examples and can be displayed or presented based entirely on area demographics or right down to the very address you are blogging about.  Even though this plugin was most beneficial in the hands of developers and web designers we have added the first version of a templated system to allow a relatively novice user the ability to customize the look and feel of the charted layouts.

1. Once you create a new Zillow template, you want to take the Zillow Template Tag which is displayed in the list at the bottom and add it to a template tag as follows `{zillow_1}, {zillow_2} and so on` The tag number is the template ID number generated automatically.
1. To style the layout templates you can either create as many templates as you so desire or use the default existing example and modify it accordingly. The template is located in the /wp-content/plugins/wp-zillow/templates folder.

1. Where are you planning to use the demographic? A page or a post.
1. Its BEST TO put the WordPress READMORE tag above the chart tag because it can make your site real long if following a standard blog format.

== What Kind Styling Can I Really Do ==
* The fact is this, we built this for our clients originally and design was first on our mind. Every element is rendered in un-ordered lists or div tags so styling has a great many potential avenues.
* You may be one of those people that say "I stumbled upon a jQuery animated example of yours, how is this possible?" Well in that instance it was modified a tad but we can share with you if you so desire.
